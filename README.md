# AHSO

This is the GitHub repository for the Animal Health Surveillance Ontology (AHSO) project. This project aims to develop an ontology for veterinary syndromic surveillance, which will facilitate the development of smart systems for disease surveillance and early disease detection that do not rely on the existence of standard coding practices at source.  

For more information on the project which is managed by the Swedish National Veterinary Institute, please go to http://www.sva.se/en/research/researches/development-of-an-ontology-for-syndromic-classification-of-animal-health-data.
To view the projectâ€™s community discussion forum, go to https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ahsontology 

**Note that AHSO is under development and its existing content requires several more rounds of editing for proper description of terms.**
